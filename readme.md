## Introduction


PHARE stands for Parallel Hybrid particle in cell code with Adaptive Mesh REfinement.
Hybrid particle-in-cell (PIC) codes solve the Vlasov equation for ions in a Lagrangian way
and assume an electron fluid.

PHARE is in development, and aims at filling the gap between sub-ion scales and large "MHD" scales
by using Adaptive Mesh Refinement, enabling to dynamically increasing the resolution in critical regions while
keeping a lower resolution elsewhere.
